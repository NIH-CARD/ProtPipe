## Subset options
--library-headers [name 1],[name 2],... specifies column names in the spectral library to be used, in the order described in Spectral library formats. Use '*' (without quotes) instead of the column name if a particular column is irrelevant, or if DIA-NN already recognises its name

## Filtering options
--no-lib-filter the input library will be used 'as is' without discarding fragments that might be harmful for the analysis; use with caution

--matrix-ch-qvalue [x] sets the 'channel q-value' used to filter the output matrices
--matrix-qvalue [x] sets the q-value used to filter the output matrices
--matrix-tr-qvalue [x] sets the 'translated q-value' used to filter the output matrices
--matrix-spec-q run-specific protein q-value filtering will be used, in addition to the global q-value filtering, when saving protein matrices. The ability to filter based on run-specific protein q-values, which allows to generate highly reliable data, is one of the advantages of DIA-NN
--sptxt-acc [N] sets the fragment filtering mass accuracy (in ppm) when reading .sptxt/.msp libraries

## Mass spec options

--mass-acc-cal [N] sets the mass accuracy used during the calibration phase of the search to N ppm (default is 100 ppm, which is adjusted automatically to lower values based on the data)

--max-fr specifies the maximum number of fragments per precursors in the spectral library being saved

--min-fr specifies the minimum number of fragments per precursors in the spectral library being saved


--min-peak sets the minimum peak height to consider. Must be 0.01 or greater
--peak-center instructs DIA-NN to integrate chromatographic peaks only in the vicinity of the apex - equivalent to the "Robust LC" quantification mode
--peak-height instructs DIA-NN to use the apex height of the peak for quantification - equivalent to the "Peak height" quantification mode
--peak-translation instructs DIA-NN to take advantage of the co-elution of isotopologues, when identifying and quantifying precursors


--mod [name],[mass],[optional: 'label'] declares a modification name. Examples: "--mod UniMod:5,43.005814", "--mod SILAC-Lys8,8.014199,label"
--mod-only only consider peptides bearing the modifications listed with --monitor-mod
--monitor-mod [name] apply PTM scoring & site localisation for a particular modification. This modification must have been declared as variable using --var-mod

--reanalyse enables MBR
--reannotate reannotate the spectral library with protein information from the FASTA database, using the specified digest specificity
--regular-swath all runs will be analysed as if they were not Scanning SWATH runs
--relaxed-prot-inf instructs DIA-NN to use a very heuristical protein inference algorithm (similar to the one used by FragPipe and many other software tools), wherein DIA-NN aims to make sure that no protein is present simultaneously in multiple protein groups. This mode (i) is recommended for method optimisation & benchmarks, (ii) might be convenient for gene set enrichment analysis and related kinds of downstream processing. However the default protein inference strategy of DIA-NN is more reliable for differential expression analyses (this is one of the advantages of DIA-NN). Equivalent to the 'Heuristic protein inference' GUI setting.
--report-lib-info adds extra library information on the precursor and its fragments to the main output report
--restrict-fr some fragments will not be used for quantification, based on the value in the ExcludeFromAssay spectral library column
--scanning-swath all runs will be analysed as if they were Scanning SWATH runs
--smart-profiling enables an intelligent algorithm which determines how to extract spectra, when creating a spectral library from DIA data. This is highly recommended and should almost always be enabled
--species-genes instructs DIA-NN to add the organism identifier to the gene names - useful for distinguishing genes from different species, when analysing mixed samples. Works with UniProt sequence databases.
--strip-unknown-mods instructs DIA-NN to ignore modifications that are not supported by the deep learning predictor, when performing the prediction
--target-fr [N] fragment ions beyond this number will only be included in the spectral library being created (from DIA data) if they have high-quality chromatograms. Default value is 6

--tims-skip-errors DIA-NN will ignore errors when loading dia-PASEF data
--use-quant use existing .quant files, if available
--verbose [N] sets the level of detail of the log. Reasonable values are in the range 0 - 4
--var-mod [name],[mass],[sites],[optional: 'label'] - adds the modification name to the list of recognised names and specifies the modification as variable. [sites] can contain a list of amino acids and 'n' which codes for the N-terminus of the peptide. '*n' indicates protein N-terminus. Examples: "--var-mod UniMod:21,79.966331,STY" - phosphorylation, "--var-mod UniMod:1,42.010565,*n" - N-terminal protein acetylation. Similar to --mod can be followed by 'label'
--var-mods sets the maximum number of variable modifications
--vis [N],[Peptide 1],[Peptide 2],... instructs DIA-NN to extract and save chromatograms in the vicinity of the detected elution apex, for all PSMs matching the stripped sequences provided, for all runs in the experiment; at least N scans in the vicinity of the apex will be extracted
--window [N] sets the scan window radius to a specific value. Ideally, should be approximately equal to the average number of data points per peak






## disabling options
--no-calibration disables mass calibration
--no-decoy-channel disables the use of a decoy channel for channel q-value calculation
--no-fr-selection the selection of fragments for quantification based on the quality assessment of the respective extracted chromatograms will be disabled
--no-ifs-removal turns off interference subtraction from fragment ion chromatograms - equivalent to the "high precision" quantification mode
--no-im-window disables IM-windowed search
--no-isotopes do not extract chromatograms for heavy isotopologues
--no-main-report do not produce the main report
--no-maxlfq disables MaxLFQ for protein quantification
--no-norm disables cross-run normalisation
--no-prot-inf disables protein inference (that is protein grouping) - protein groups from the spectral library will be used instead
--no-quant-files instructs DIA-NN not to save .quant files to disk and store them in memory instead
--no-rt-window disables RT-windowed search
--no-stats disables the generation of the stats file
--no-stratification disables precursor stratification based on the modification status. Stratification works in combination with --monitor-mod to ensure that no matter how few modified peptides are reported, the FDR specifically across modified peptides is well controlled
--no-swissprot instruct DIA-NN not to give preference for SwissProt proteins when inferring protein groups
--original-mods disables the automatic conversion of known modifications to the UniMod format names
--duplicate-proteins instructs DIA-NN not to skip entries in the sequence database with duplicate IDs (while by default if several entries have the same protein ID, all but the first entry will be skipped)


## Experimental options
--il-eq (experimental) when using the 'Reannotate' function, peptides will be matched to proteins while considering isoleucine and leucine equivalent
--lib [file name] specifies a spectral library. The use of multiple --lib commands (experimental) allows to load multiple libraries in .tsv format
--channels [channel 1]; [channel 2]; ... (experimental) lists multiplexing channels, wherein each channel declaration has the form [channel] = [label group],[channel name],[sites],[mass1:mass2:...], wherein [sites] has the same syntax as for --var-mod and if N sites are listed, N masses are listed at the end of the channel declaration. Examples: "--channels SILAC,L,KR,0:0; SILAC,H,KR,8.014199:10.008269" - declares standard light/heavy SILAC labels, "--channels mTRAQ,0,nK,0:0; mTRAQ,4,nK,4.0070994:4.0070994;mTRAQ,8,nK,8.0141988132:8.0141988132" - declares mTRAQ. The spectral library will be automatically split into multiple channels, for precursors bearing the [label group] modification. To add the latter to a label-free spectral library, can use --lib-fixed-mod, e.g. --fixed-mod SILAC,0.0,KR,label --lib-fixed-mod SILAC. The --channels command must be used in conjunction with --peak-translation.
--quick-mass-acc (experimental) when choosing the MS2 mass accuracy setting automatically, DIA-NN will use a fast heuristical algorithm instead of IDs number optimisation
--semi (experimental) when using the 'Reannotate' function, a peptide will be matched to a protein also if it could be obtained with one specific and one non-specific cut (at either of the termini)
