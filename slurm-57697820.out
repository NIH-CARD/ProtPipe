DIA-NN 1.8.1 (Data-Independent Acquisition by Neural Networks)
Compiled on Apr 15 2022 08:45:18
Current date and time: Thu Feb  2 09:19:23 2023
Logical CPU cores: 32
Thread number set to 24
Output will be filtered at 0.01 FDR
Precursor/protein x samples expression level matrices will be saved along with the main report
A spectral library will be generated
Deep learning will be used to generate a new in silico spectral library from peptides provided
Library-free search enabled
Min fragment m/z set to 200
Max fragment m/z set to 2000
N-terminal methionine excision enabled
In silico digest will involve cuts at K*,R*
Maximum number of missed cleavages set to 2
Min peptide length set to 7
Max peptide length set to 52
Min precursor m/z set to 300
Max precursor m/z set to 1800
Min precursor charge set to 1
Max precursor charge set to 4
Cysteine carbamidomethylation enabled as a fixed modification
Maximum number of variable modifications set to 5
Modification UniMod:35 with mass delta 15.9949 at M will be considered as variable
Modification UniMod:1 with mass delta 42.0106 at *n will be considered as variable
A spectral library will be created from the DIA runs and used to reanalyse them; .quant files will only be saved to disk during the first step
Highly heuristic protein grouping will be used, to reduce the number of protein groups obtained; this mode is recommended for benchmarking protein ID numbers; use with caution for anything else
When generating a spectral library, in silico predicted spectra will be retained if deemed more reliable than experimental ones
Fixed-width center of each elution peak will be used for quantification
Interference removal from fragment elution curves disabled
WARNING: skipping tiny/tiny.mxML - invalid raw MS data format
Exclusion of fragments shared between heavy and light peptides from quantification is not supported in FASTA digest mode - disabled; to enable, generate an in silico predicted spectral library and analyse with this library
The following variable modifications will be scored: UniMod:1 
WARNING: MBR turned off, two or more raw files are required

0 files will be processed
